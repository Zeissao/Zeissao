# WELCOME TO MY HOMEPAGE! 👋 
## > ABOUT ME 😀
>> I'm an undergraduate from Xi'an Jiaotong University majoring in electrical engineering and its automation, and I'm learning Python and HTML recently. In the next semister, I'm going to learn C, which is believed to be harder and more complicated than Python. Anyway, I'll try my best to have a good command of it. This is my first github account and repository, so it may seems not that beautiful and organised due to the unfamiliar operation of this site. Last but not least, warmly welcome to communicate with me, the contact information is listed on the bottom!
